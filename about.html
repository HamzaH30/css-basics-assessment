          Inspired by the Mughlai cuisine found in the vast lands of the Mughal
          Empire, Mughals & Co. has been serving authentic Mughlai dishes to the
          public for over 50 years!

          The Mughal Empire was an early modern Islamic empire situated in South
          Asia. They ruled the Indian subcontinent for over 2 centuries. Arts,
          trades, literature, and especially architecture, flourished within the
          empire. Many sites built in the Mughal Empire are now UNESCO World
          Heritage Sites, the most popular being the Taj Mahal, described as the
          “jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired
          masterpieces of the world's heritage.”

          Along with Mughal rule, came a cuisine rich in colour, spices, aroma,
          and taste. Recipes that were perfected over time by skilled chefs and
          prepared only for the Emperors and Royalty have now become the icon of
          South Asian cuisine. Many common Indian foods such as biryani, kebabs,
          kofte, and pilau all originate from Mughlai cuisine.

          Mughlai cooking was a unique style of cooking that was unbeknownst to
          the world at the time. It included spices and herbs found only in the
          corners of the empire and used a variety of cooking techniques from
          all over the empire. The curries and stews are mixed with the purest
          butter, milk, and cream. The traditional Mughlai desserts are
          elegantly spiced with saffron, cardamom, and cinnamon.
